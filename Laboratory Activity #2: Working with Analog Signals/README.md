## Working with Digital Signals

### Course
**COSC 111 – Internet of Things**

---

## 📌 Objective
The objective of this laboratory activity is to understand and work with basic digital signals and their behavior in digital systems. This activity introduces fundamental concepts essential to digital electronics and Internet of Things (IoT) applications.

---

## 🧪 Description
In this laboratory activity, digital signals were explored through hands-on experimentation using an Arduino microcontroller. The activity demonstrates how digital signals operate using binary states (`HIGH` and `LOW`), signal transitions, and timing control.

By controlling multiple LEDs connected to digital pins, the activity illustrates how digital outputs behave in real-world electronic systems. This reinforces foundational concepts such as:
- Binary logic
- Digital signal transitions
- Output pin configuration
- Timing and sequencing in digital systems

These concepts are critical for understanding how sensors, actuators, and controllers interact in IoT environments.

## 🧠 Activity Overview
The Arduino program:
- Configures multiple digital pins as outputs
- Turns LEDs **ON sequentially** with a fixed delay
- Turns LEDs **OFF sequentially** with the same delay
- Repeats the process continuously using the `loop()` function

This creates a visible representation of digital signal changes over time.
